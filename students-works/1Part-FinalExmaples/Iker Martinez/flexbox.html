                <p id="first">Flexbox is a new design module in CSS3 to improve the way we do Responsive Design, 
                thus avoiding the use of float (Do not use float to do responsive design). Thanks to 
                FlexBox we facilitate the way we position elements, it is simpler and we use less code.
                To start working with FlexBox you first have to understand the structure, FlexBox is made
                up of a father (Container - Flex) and his children (Element - Flex).</p>

                <p>Flexbox underlying principle is to make layouts flexible and intuitive.
                To accomplish this, it lets containers decide for themselves how to evenly distribute 
                their children including their size and the space between them.
                This all sounds good in principle. But let’s see what it looks like in practice.</p>
